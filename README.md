## Bookmark page 
I have created a bookmark page using html,css and JavaScript. 
The users can add their favorite book and a review of it using a pop-up window. 
The output will be like as below.... 

### You can add a book by clicking the (+) button

### You can view your book collection like this, if you don't want a book you can delete it...
